BLM-Basic-Starter-WordPress-Theme-With-Slider
=============================================

Basic WordPress starter themes with home page featured slider.

This is theme is a continuation of my work with the original BLM Basic starter themes. 
(https://github.com/crondeau/BLM-Basic-Starter-WordPress-Theme-HTML5)

I use this theme for building all my sites, and more and more designers request featured sliders.
I've built many over the years and found that Nathan's Slides.js to be the best - http://slidesjs.com/
His slideshow plugin for jQuery is very well explained and comes with great documentation. 
 
I've integrated his slider in this theme and set it to display on the front-page. 
To enable the slider, you simply need to upload two or more images on the page you choose to use as your front page. 
The images and css are set to 940px x 280px. 


--------------------------------------------------------

THIS THEME IS TO BE USED FOR BUILDING CUSTOM THEMES ONLY.

Just like the original version, this theme is devoid of design elements and so won't look that great out of the box.
It's also missing some recommended features which would be needed if you wanted to release a theme in the WordPress repository.

If you want to create a simple custom theme, this might be the theme for you.
So check it out.

You can check out a demo of the theme here.
